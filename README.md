# HTML Templates #

Starting templates used for all (most) of my projects. Includes a CSS reset, HTML file, and some javascript plugins I've found handy.

CSS Reset is based on the work of [Eric Meyer](http://meyerweb.com/) and [Thierry Koblentz](http://twitter.com/thierrykoblentz). The rest is from my own experience and research. Send any comments or feedback to [@valloq](http://twitter.com/valloq).
